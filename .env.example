# Ethereum private key for signing on‑chain transactions.  
# In a production deployment this value must not be committed to source
# control.  The provided services will load it via the common/eth_signer
# module.  If omitted the DEX executor will not attempt to sign and send
# transactions.

# Flashbots relay endpoint used by the MEV adapter.  This can be a
# Flashbots Protect RPC or MEV Blocker RPC.  See the documentation
# in services/executor_dex/mev_adapter.py for details.

# SUAVE or MEV share relayer (optional).  This value can be used to
# send bundles through SUAVE once the network is publicly available.

# CROSS_TO_CHAIN defines a destination chain for cross‑chain quoting.
# If set to a non‑empty value (e.g. solana), the DEX connector will
# publish cross‑chain quotes using 1inch Fusion+ simulation.

# 1inch Dev Portal API key used by the Fusion+ gateway.  Obtain this key
# from https://portal.1inch.dev/dashboard and set it here to enable
# real Fusion+ API calls.  Leave blank to run in simulation mode.
ONE_INCH_DEV_API_KEY=

# Default source chain identifier used by the Fusion+ gateway when
# creating quotes and orders.  The chain identifiers follow the
# numeric IDs supported by the 1inch SDK (e.g. 1 for Ethereum Mainnet,
# 56 for BNB Smart Chain).  Adjust these values to match the
# environment in which your swaps will originate.  See the 1inch
# documentation for a complete list.
SRC_CHAIN_ID=1

# Default destination chain identifier for cross‑chain quotes.  When
# provided, the DEX connector will emit cross‑chain Fusion and Fusion+
# quotes to Kafka.  The Fusion gateway also uses this value when
# creating quotes if none is supplied in the request body.
DST_CHAIN_ID=137

# The port on which the Fusion+ gateway listens.  The Docker Compose
# configuration maps this port to the same port on the host machine.
