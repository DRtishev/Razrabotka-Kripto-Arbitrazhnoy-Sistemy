"""
bridge_adapter
==============

This service provides a scaffold for cross‑chain bridging operations
required by cross‑chain arbitrage strategies.  When an arbitrage
opportunity spans multiple blockchains (e.g. an asset is purchased on
Ethereum and sold on BSC), it is necessary to transfer tokens between
chains using bridging protocols such as Axelar, LayerZero or
Wormhole.  The bridge adapter abstracts over the details of these
protocols and exposes a common interface for initiating bridges and
monitoring their status.

The implementation here is a placeholder: outbound HTTP calls are
commented out and replaced with logging.  In a production system you
would integrate with the chosen bridge provider's API or smart
contracts.  See the research notes for considerations when
selecting a bridge provider.
